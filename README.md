# Declaration
I declare that the website template currently utilized on [This github page](https://MoradSayed.github.io) has been acquired from a third-party source and is not an original creation.

I acknowledge that the design, layout, and certain functionalities of this website are based on a pre-existing template that I have obtained through [buckymaler](https://buckymaler.com/).

Furthermore, I affirm that while I have customized and adapted certain elements of the template to suit my specific needs, the core structure and design concepts remain the intellectual property of the original template creator.


## original README.md

Global is a modern and sleek website template crafted for professionals in the creative industry. Global can serve as a single page portfolio or be easily modified to serve as the perfect beginning for a hip creative agency.

The original PSD is included and was provided by [Sergey Melnik](https://www.behance.net/SergeyMelnik).

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
